# how-to-save-your-bacon

Talk about git and how git can save your day!

## Abstract

"If you are not using git yet, you should. One day, you're going to thank git for saving your bacon. 

In this talk, we're going to go way beyond git clone, git pull, git commit and git push. Sure, we're going to cover the basics in the first 5 minutes, but then we're going to show you with some real-life stories how git got us out of trouble."

## Agenda

1. Git basics
   - git init

    Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

   - git clone

    Clone a repository into a new directory

   - git fetch
   - git pull

    git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn't do any file transfering. It's more like just checking to see if there are any changes available). git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.

   - git commit

    Record changes to the repository

   - git push

    Update remote refs along with associated objects

2. Beyond the basics
   - git checkout

    Switch branches or restore working tree files

   - git branch

    List, create, or delete branches

   - git diff

    Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

   - git merge

    Join two or more development histories together

   - git rebase

    Reapply commits on top of another base tip

3. Rebase vs Merge vs Squash + story
4. Stash is your friend + story
5. Amend is your friend + story
