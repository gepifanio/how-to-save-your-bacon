# How to save your bacon

## Talk

Talk about git and how git can save your day!

## Abstract

"If you are not using git yet, you should. One day, you're going to thank git for saving your bacon. 

In this talk, we're going to go way beyond git clone, git pull, git commit and git push. Sure, we're going to cover the basics in the first 5 minutes, but then we're going to show you with some real-life stories how git got us out of trouble."
